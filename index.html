                    <p>Web development offers the kinds of challenges I'm interested in solving, and there is a market need for people to solve them - I would feel <span class="italic">useful</span> by doing this work.</p>
                    <p>The F&C Skills Bootcamp seems to offer a strong route into apprenticeships and employment - something that, as a career-change candidate, is very important to me.</p>
